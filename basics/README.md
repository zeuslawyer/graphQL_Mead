#Operations
Broadly two types - Queries and Mutations.

#typeDefs
This is how you define the type of __Operations__ and the data types.

Data in GraphQL fall into two broad categories. They are: 
1) scalar types (store a single, discrete value). 
2) collections of scalars (objects/arrays)

But they fall into 5 types...

String | Boolean (true/false) | Int | Float | ID (capitals. often are Strings) 

#Resolvers
1) are objects
2) have methods as properties
3) these methods return data, which must conform to the type definitions
